eBook -PowerShell 7 Workshop - Nick Parlow

Preface
---------
The book is split into 3 parts. 

Part 1
------------------ 
> we cover traditional coding theory; starting with how PowerShell works as a language, 
we look at the building blocks of the language and then move on to how we can combine them in a programmatic flow.

Part 2
----------------- 
> we start to put together the principles we’ve learned into scripts and modules that we can share and reuse.

Part 3
----------------- 
> we look at how PowerShell works in different environments, 
before finishing with a chapter on how we can access the underlying framework that PowerShell is built on.


Part 1: PowerShell Fundamentals
=================================
In this part, we’ll learn about the basics of PowerShell, how the language syntax works, how we can send the results of one operation straight 
into another with the pipeline, how PowerShell uses objects, variables, and data structures, how we can create branched and looped code, and 
finally, how we can write to and from stored files.

    Chapter 1, Introduction to PowerShell – What It Is and How to Get It
    Chapter 2, Exploring PowerShell Cmdlets and Syntax
    Chapter 3, The PowerShell Pipeline – How to String Cmdlets Together
    Chapter 4, PowerShell Variables and Data Structures
    Chapter 5, PowerShell Control Flow – Conditionals and Loops
    Chapter 6, PowerShell and Files – Reading, Writing, and Manipulating Data
    Chapter 7, PowerShell and the Web – HTTP, REST, and JSON

Part 2: Scripting and Toolmaking
This part walks you through turning a set of cmdlets into a script, introduces functional programming, shows you how to turn scripts into modules, and how to share those modules with colleagues and others using GitHub and GitLab. It also includes a chapter on PowerShell security, so that you don’t inadvertently distribute code that is less secure than it could be.

This part has the following chapters:

Chapter 8, Writing Our First Script – Turning Simple Cmdlets into Reusable Code
Chapter 9, Don’t Repeat Yourself – Functions and Scriptblocks
Chapter 10, Error Handling – Oh No! It’s Gone Wrong!
Chapter 11, Creating Our First Module
Chapter 12, Securing PowerShell
