What is PowerShell 7?

    PowerShell is a scripting language and an alternative to the command-line interface. 
    PowerShell is an automation tool consisting of (at least) 3 parts:


        1. A shell, like the Command Prompt in Windows or the Terminal in Linux or macOS
        2. A scripting language
        3. A configuration management framework called Desired State Configuration (DSC)

there are two main flavors of PowerShell: 
1. Windows PowerShell: which comes bundled with both server and desktop versions of Windows, and 
2. PowerShell 7: which must be downloaded and installed.
